# How I Got Hooked on Machine Learning 🎯

If you had asked me a year ago what “machine learning” was, I would’ve probably said something vague like “robot stuff.” I had no clue it would become the thing that keeps me up at night (out of curiosity, not fear hein).

As a Business graduate, I was always drawn to understanding how things work, especially **systems**. I love breaking down problems, identifying patterns, and asking: _“Why is this happening?”_

That mindset slowly led me into data. First Excel. Then SQL. Then one day I stumbled into a YouTube video that showed how an algorithm could learn to predict customer churn — and my brain lit up.

> ''Wait a second… you’re telling me I can teach a system to spot problems… before they even happen?''

That’s all it took.

I’ve since started self-learning:

- Python and scikit-learn
- How to build models from scratch
- How to turn business questions into ML problems

And it’s just the beginning.

Machine learning isn’t magic. It’s systems, patterns, data, and logic — things I’ve always loved. I just didn’t know it had a name.

Stay tuned for more as I document my journey, one model (and mistake) at a time.
